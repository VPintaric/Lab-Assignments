# Lab-Assignments
This is a repository full of various lab assignments I coded during my education at Faculty of Eletrical Engineering and Computing.

Labs are sorted by courses.
With some of the labs there will be a *readme* file with a short explanation for the corresponding task.

**Most of the code is not commented whatsoever, I will add comments and explanations as I find the time to do so.**
